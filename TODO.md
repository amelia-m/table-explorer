# TODO

- [x] Add a "Hide empty tables" toggle (0-row tables) to the sidebar that filters
      them out of the ERD, Table Details, and Relationships views.
- [ ] (Maybe later) User-defined naming patterns for FK detection: a settings
      box for lookup-table prefix (e.g. `tlk_`), lookup key column (e.g. `id`)
      and FK template (e.g. `{entity}_id`), saved with the session. Built-in
      conventions (Access, Rails/Django, SQL Server, warehouse `_key`/`_sk`,
      code lookups, role prefixes) are detected automatically already.
